            <span class="card-text">The world is a beautiful place, and its beauty is often celebrated in famous lists like the 7 Wonders of the World or the 7 Natural Wonders of the World. UNESCO World Heritage Sites are another way to recognize and bring attention to amazing places. However, there are many other wonderful places on the globe that are sometimes missed on popular lists. Narrowing these beautiful places down to just 15 is a difficult task, but this list presents a compelling overview of awe-inspiring scenes from near and far.</span>

                        history, but also its blue hue. The city got its color from Jewish refuges who, in the 1930s,
                        painted the walls and streets blue as a reminder of God’s power.</span>

                        irrigation system that taps water from the adjacent forest. Though there is little rice farming
                        on the terraces, tourism is booming as thousands of people come to see the site, as well as
